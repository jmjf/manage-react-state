## Forms and form validation

Time to build a checkout form.

-  Verify data when it changes
-  Know what changed
-  Use derived state for validation values (I'm guessing flags?)
-  A state enum (???)

## Create the form

He provides the code. Let's try to understand what we're doing before we copy/paste.

-  `Checkout.tsx`
-  Start by returning a `<div>`
-  Add it to routes in `App`
-  Works so far

**COMMIT: 5.0.1 - FEAT: create stub checkout component and wire into routes**
