# Training plan (adjusted)

From `07-Reducers.md`.

## Looking ahead and adjusting plans

DF 100 this weekend may affect how much time I have to spend on training on Fr/Sa/Su. List below is based on the Pluralsight pathway sequence.

-  About 1h 20m left in this course; context may move faster because it was covered in the previous course
   -  probably 2-3 days, depending on how much time I can spend this week
   -  Same instructor has a long course that covers almost everything, but it's 2017, so probably a bit out of date
-  About 1h of styling; inline, CSS in JS, stylesheets, CSS modules;
   -  probably 3-ish days because some of this is new
-  About 1h 30m on server side rendering; React 16, so I'll probably spend time looking at 17/18 differences
   -  probably 4-ish days
-  About 2h 30m on testing; React 16, so time to check 17/18 differences
   -  7-10 days maybe
-  About 1h 50m on forms (React 17); part overlaps this course, but also covers Formik and React Hook Form
   -  5-7 days?
-  About 1h on performance tuning
   -  3-4 days maybe
-  About 6h 45m on apps with Redux; React 16, so check 17/18 differences; given pace on this course (same instructor)
   -  About 1h is environment setup and app basics (covers topics I should know)
   -  About 35m is testing (should be solid on it by the time I get to this)
   -  Let's say 14 days, maybe less because Redux is similar to VueX (reverse actually), and reducers
-  About 3h 20m on hooks; I see maybe 2h of interesting new content; rest covers known topics but some of the examples might be useful
   -  I may be selective or move quickly and go light on notes unless I see something new or interesting
   -  Let's say 7 days max and aim for less
-  About 1h 10m on choosing a framework
   -  Aim to understand considerations (tradeoffs)
   -  3-4 days
-  About 2h 15m on calling APIs
   -  Some of the topics are review-ish (fetch, axios, etc.)
   -  7 days?
-  About 1h on large data sets; mostly pagination, infinte scroll, windowing
   -  3 days max
-  About 1h on using TypeScript; which I'm already doing
   -  3 days max
-  About 1h on security; XSS, DOM injection, JSON data injection
   -  3 days max

Finishing all that would run to mid-September (estimated). I want to do the coursework, but I also want to start a self-driven project and learn with something practical.

## Top priorities

-  Testing -- I want to move into a self-driven project, but tests are essential -- 7-10 d
-  Redux -- must have knowledge and will be useful for self-driven project -- ~14 d (end of July)
-  Styling -- Move through it quickly -- 3 d
   -  Investigate UI libraries
   -  Investigate forms libraries and how they play with UI libraries
   -  Consider selectively watching parts of the forms course
-  Look at dominant React frameworks (CRA, Next, Gatsby, etc.)
   -  Plan the self-driven project to allow you to start simple and move later without a lot of pain
   -  Consider speed watching the "choosing a framework" course to get the basics

Following are important, but secondary

-  Security -- top of the secondary list; not required to start self-driven project
-  Calling APIs -- I have the basics, but hope to have an API for the project, so want to be sure I have some depth here
-  SSR -- I want to be sure I understand it, but don't know if I'll use it any time soon
-  Large data sets -- worth knowing, but not likely to come into play until later in the self-driven project (if at all)
-  Performance tuning -- later stage of the project; avoid premature optimization (unless it's obviously good)
-  Hooks -- this is a deeper dive into the various hooks; I can probably work with React docs and some "when to use" guidance for now
-  Forms -- I'll do some research myself for the self-driven project, so this is secondary
-  Choosing a framework -- if speed watched, consider a closer review
-  TypeScript -- I seem to be working pretty well with some Google help

So, I could be ready to start a self-driven project in early August, which would be good. I have some ideas I'll sketch out elsewhere.
